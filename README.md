# Producer-Consumer
Implemented an example of the producer-consumer problem using System V semaphores and shared memory. Developed two separate programs, `producer.cpp` and `consumer.cpp`, that communicate with each other using semaphores for synchronization and shared memory for inter-process communication. The program demonstrated the use of concurrency and synchronization techniques to solve a classic problem in computer science.
